## ðŸ“š CSCI - Natural Language Processing - A

In this section, I showcase my work from the CSCI NLP course, including assignments and a final project. This course has deepened my understanding of how machine learning contributes to text analysis tasks, such as:

- **Sarcasm Detection**: Exploring models that attempt to predict sarcasm in text and the limitations posed by nuances in language and culture.
- **Language Recognition**: Applying machine learning models to identify languages in varied contexts.

### Final Project

My final project focused on the complexities and potential of using machine learning within NLP. Some of the key questions I investigated included:

- **Role of Machine Learning as a Variable**: While machine learning can perform predictions and classifications, in social science, it often serves more effectively as a variable extraction tool. This approach highlights patterns without necessarily providing causal explanations.
- **Data Accessibility in Computational Social Science**: As I delved into this field, I recognized a vast potential for enhancing data accessibility, improving the integration of NLP techniques with social science research.

### Reflections

This project prompted me to reflect on the ways that computational methods and social science can work together. My goal is to push beyond standard applications, expanding the scope of machine learning for a deeper understanding of societal questions.
